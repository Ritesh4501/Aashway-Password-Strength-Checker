# Password Strength Checker Tool

## Overview
The **Password Strength Checker Tool** is a Python-based desktop application built using `Tkinter`. It helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords in real-time and provides feedback based on several password criteria such as length, use of uppercase/lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters.

### Features:
- **Real-time Password Evaluation**: As you type, the strength of your password is assessed.
- **Dynamic Progress Bar**: A color-changing progress bar (red -> orange -> green) visually indicates password strength.
- **Strength Feedback**: Text feedback is displayed based on the strength of the password (Weak, Medium, or Strong).
- **Strong Password Suggestions**: A button generates a strong, random password.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
